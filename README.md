Data Scraping: I scraped user and repository data from public GitHub profiles using Python's requests library and BeautifulSoup, collecting information such as login, location, followers, and public repositories.

Surprising Fact: One surprising finding was that despite the common belief that more public repositories lead to more followers, the regression analysis indicated a negative correlation, showing users with more repositories often had fewer followers.

Actionable Recommendation: Developers should focus on quality over quantity when creating repositories, as engaging content and effective networking may yield better follower growth than simply increasing the number of publicÂ repositories.
